            <h3>RECOMENDATION:</h3>
            <p> From my own experience through preparing SAT proccess I concluded that the ERICA MELTZER's books are very beneficial who started learning conceptions and rules of grammar. So if you are novice do not start learning from SAT reading. Instead it learn grammar which is much more easy to handle ! </p>

        <p class="brown"> Grammar <br>
            1. Period = Semicolon = Comma + and/but <br>
            2. 2 commas = 2 dashes = non-essential clause. When crossed out, the sentence still makes sense.  <br>
            3. It’s = it is; Its = possessive form of it; its’ = does not exist  <br>
            4. Colon = list or explanation. Need a complete sentence before but not after. <br> 
            5. BEING, usually = WRONG  <br>
            6. Could/would/should/might HAVE, not OF <br>
            7. No comma before or after a preposition (of, by, to, at, for, from, with, in, on) , or the word that <br>
            8. Comma before it, he, she, they usually = WRONG <br>
            9. Singular verbs end in –s, plural verbs do not end in –s (e.g. she reads, they read) <br> 
            10. Keep pronouns consistent: one = one, you = you  <br>
            11. Who is for people, which is for things, where is for places (e.g. the time/book where = WRONG) <br>
            12. Use who before a verb (who went, NOT whom went); use whom after a preposition (e.g. by whom,  
             NOT by who). <br>
            13. All items in a list must match (noun, noun, noun or verb, verb, verb) <br>
            14. Always underline NOT, LEAST, and EXCEPT <br>  <br>
            <p  class="green" ;> Good luck for your studies</p>
